## MetaStruct::Graph

`MetaStruct::Graph` - directed acyclic graph. Realized as a representational data structure (without mutation interfaces).

- [Graph Invariants](#graph-invariants)
- [Graph Creation](#graph-creation)

---

### Graph Invariants:

- has only one root node;
- has no non-connected nodes;
- has no cycles (in development);
- has exit (at least one);

---

### Graph Creation

- create node `MetaStruct::Graph::Node`:

```ruby
MetaStruct::Graph::Node.create(
  uuid: _your_uuid_, # autogenerated via SecureRandom.uuid by default
  labels: _your_labels_, # [] by default
  properties: _your_properties_ # {} by default
)
```

- create edge `MetaStruct::Graph::Edge`:

```ruby
MetaStruct::Graph::Edge.create(
  left_node: _your_left_node_, # an instance of MetaStruct::Graph::Node
  right_node: _your_right_node_, # an instance of MetaStruct::Graph::Node
  labels: _your_labels_, # [] by default
  properties: _your_properties_, # {} by default
  weight: _your_weight_ # 0 by default
)
```

- build graph `MetaStruct::Graph`:
  - fails on duplicated nodes (nodes with duplicated `uuid`s);
  - fails on duplicated edges (duplicated edge objects wich have identical left and right nodes);
  - fails on situation, when node has no edge entity (presented in edge list);
  - fails on situation, when edge has node which is not presented in node list;

```ruby
MetaStruct::Graph.create(
  nodes: _your_array_of_nodes_, # [] by default
  edges: _your_array_of_edges # [] by default
)
```
