## MetaStruct::Graph

*MetaStruct::Graph* - directed acyclic graph. Realized as a representational data structure (without mutation interfaces).

### Creation

- create `MetaStruct::Graph::Node`s:

```ruby
MetaStruct::Graph::Node.create(
  uuid: _your_uuid_, # autogenerated via SecureRandom.uuid by default
  labels: _your_labels_, # [] by default
  properties: _your_properties_ # {} by default
)
```

- create `MetaStruct::Graph::Edge`s:

```ruby
MetaStruct::Graph::Edge.create(
  left_node: _your_left_node_, # an instance of MetaStruct::Graph::Node
  right_node: _your_right_node_, # an instance of MetaStruct::Graph::Node
  labels: _your_labels_, # [] by default
  properties: _your_properties_, # {} by default
  weight: _your_weight_ # 0 by default
)
```

- build graph via appropriated factory method:

```ruby
MetaStruct::Graph.create(
  nodes: _your_array_of_nodes_, # [] by default
  edges: _your_array_of_edges # [] by default
)
```
